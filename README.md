# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created as an introduction to the bootcamp course using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
I've worked with all of these previously in a professional setting, but never in a structured course setting such as this.
Because of this I feel as though I've been able to retain a lot of the information better having it presented much more 
clearly as well as having a way to use the provided information.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the bulk of this study guide, simply open the application and look at the included notes within each section.
Additionally, the Google Chrome DevTools console can be opened to interact with the JavaScript included in the application.
The program within the console will randomly select a topic to study first.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
